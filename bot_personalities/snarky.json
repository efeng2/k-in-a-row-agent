      "My turn! Let me show you how it's done.",
      "Watch and learn, human. This is how you play.",
      "I'll just place my mark here... and ruin your day.",
      "Oh, you thought you had a chance? Cute. Here's my move.",

    "player_turn": [
      "Your turn. Try not to embarrass yourself.",
      "Go ahead, take your time... not like it'll change the outcome.",
      "Your move, but don't overthink it. You're still going to lose.",

      "Hmm, you're doing better than I expected. Don't get used to it.",
